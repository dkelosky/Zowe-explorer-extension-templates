# Project Description

[Zowe](https://www.zowe.org) is an integrated and extensible open source framework for z/OS which offers modern interfaces to interact with z/OS and allows you to work with z/OS in a way that is similar to what you experience on cloud platforms today. You can use these interfaces as delivered or through plug-ins and extensions.The Zowe Explorer Extension is a Visual Studio Code extension that modernizes the way developers and system administrators interact with z/OS mainframes. 

The main goal of this project is to create a zowe CLI plugin [(cURL)](https://curl.se/) which will get data from a REST API in the [Zowe Sample API Service](https://github.com/zowe/sample-spring-boot-api-service/blob/master/zowe-rest-api-sample-spring/README.md) and bring back response to the User in JSON format, and then VS CODE Extension will be build on top of the developed zowe CLI plugin [(cURL)](https://curl.se/)
